Fake news is an escalating issue on social media platforms such as Twitter, where research indicates that it spreads significantly faster than true stories, driven not by bots but by users who actively engage with and retweet inaccurate information (Dizikes, 2018). This rapid spread can be attributed to users’ pursuit of novelty, as sensational or unexpected content garners more engagement, making false stories 70% more likely to be retweeted and reaching 1,500 users six times faster than factual stories (Dizikes, 2018). In the attention economy, misinformation holds a competitive edge over accurate information because it is not limited by factual constraints, allowing it to be presented in ways that maximise attention capture (Acerbi, 2019). 


The societal consequences of this phenomenon are profound. Misinformation can lead to public confusion, increased polarisation, and an erosion of trust in reliable information sources (Altay et al., 2020). This has fostered widespread disengagement with news media as people grow increasingly sceptical of both true and false content, further blurring distinctions between reliable and misleading sources (Barthel et al., 2016). In an era where information shapes public opinion and behaviour, the unchecked spread of false news poses risks to social cohesion and informed decision-making (Wagner & Boczkowski, 2019). Hence, there is a need to identify fake tweets to prevent their dissemination in the media. 

Given the features available in our dataset, we implemented and evaluated several machine learning and deep learning models. The models chosen—Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) — are widely recognized for their effectiveness in classification tasks, particularly in text analysis and feature-based models.
